## Key Findings

### 1. Workforce Composition and Demographics

- **Employee Distribution:**  
  The organization maintains a sizable workforce, with a clear delineation between active (83.9%) and inactive (16.1%) employees, emphasizing the importance of monitoring employee engagement and turnover.
  
- **Age and Gender Trends:**  
  Visualizations segmented by age bins reveal the distribution of employees from under 20 to over 50 years, with further segmentation by gender providing insights into diversity and inclusion initiatives.
  
- **Marital Status and Ethnicity:**  
  The workforce comprises approximately 42.45% married, 37.35% single, and 20.2% divorced employees. Ethnicity analysis shows variable average salary trends, which can be instrumental for equitable pay reviews and compensation planning.

### 2. Attrition Analysis

- **Overall Attrition Rate:**  
  The current attrition rate stands at 16.1%, prompting a closer review of departmental and job role-specific trends.
  
- **Departmental and Job Role Insights:**  
  - Attrition rates vary significantly by department. For example, departments such as Sales and Technology display distinct attrition patterns when analyzed by job roles.
  - Detailed visuals show that certain roles (e.g., specific positions within Technology and Human Resources) have higher attrition percentages, suggesting the need for targeted retention strategies.
  
- **Temporal and Behavioral Factors:**  
  - **Attrition by Hire Date:**  
    Analysis indicates fluctuations in attrition percentages depending on the year of hiring, reflecting potential shifts in onboarding practices or market conditions.
  - **Attrition by Travel Frequency and Overtime:**  
    Employees requiring frequent travel or those working overtime exhibit varying attrition rates, providing clues to workload balance and potential areas for policy improvement.
  - **Attrition by Tenure:**  
    The relationship between years at the company and attrition rate reveals that longer-tenured employees may exhibit different attrition behaviors compared to new hires.

### 3. Performance Evaluation

- **Performance Tracker Metrics:**  
  The Power BI dashboards capture multiple dimensions of employee performance:
  - **Job Satisfaction:** Fluctuations in satisfaction levels over time indicate areas where job design and management practices could be enhanced.
  - **Relationship Satisfaction and Self Rating:** These metrics offer insights into personal development and interpersonal dynamics within teams.
  - **Work-Life Balance, Manager Rating, and Environment Satisfaction:** Trends in these categories inform management decisions regarding work culture enhancements and environmental improvements.
